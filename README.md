## Examples of using the `openiap` library

This repository contains examples of using the `openiap` library to interact with the OpenIAP SDK.
cli.php is a basic commandline interface to interact with the OpenIAP SDK.
test.php contains examples of calling most commands in the OpenIAP SDK.
Since vs.code does not allow setting "console": "integratedTerminal", for php, you need to run it from the command line your self, to send input to the script.
using
```php
php src/cli.php
```

make sure to install the dependencies first by running
```bash
composer install
```
